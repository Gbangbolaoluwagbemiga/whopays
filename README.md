# WhoPays - On-Chain Social Payments on Celo

A decentralized application (dApp) that makes splitting bills fun and fair. When you're out with friends, let the blockchain decide who pays!

## 🎯 What is WhoPays?

WhoPays is a social payment platform built on the Celo blockchain. Instead of arguing about who pays the bill, add your friends' names, spin the wheel, and let the smart contract randomly select the "unlucky" payer. The selected person pays the full amount on-chain, and the funds are securely transferred to the merchant.

## ✨ Features

- **🎡 Interactive Spinner**: Smooth, animated wheel that randomly selects a payer using verifiable on-chain logic.
- **👥 Multiplayer Lobbies**: Create a room, share a QR code, and let everyone join on their own device in real-time.
- **💬 Real-time Chat & AI Analysis**: Trash talk, send reactions, and query the **PayBot AI Agent** to analyze on-chain fairness histories.
- **🔐 Trustless & Self-Verified**: On-chain selection ensures fair results every time. Built with ERC-8004 AI Agent standards.
- **📱 Mobile-First**: Optimized for Celo MiniPay with a custom full-screen glassmorphism dashboard overlay for mobile users.
- **🏆 NFT Rewards & Profile**: Earn "WhoPays Badges" as soulbound NFTs for being the squad's savior, and view your stats on a dedicated profile page.

### 🚀 Upcoming "Daily Driver" Features (Beta)
- **📸 AI Receipt Scanner**: Snap a picture of your physical receipt. PayBot's vision models will extract the items, calculate the math (including tip), and auto-assign the exact splits in the lobby.
- **📅 Group Tabs**: Beyond single sessions, create an ongoing "Roommate Tab" or "Travel Squad Tab". The AI tracks running balances on-chain and auto-settles the net differences at the end of the month in cUSD via MiniPay.
